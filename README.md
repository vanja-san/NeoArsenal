[NeoArsenal
](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/neoarsenal) is a mod that adds a new FE-powered toolset made from a new material: *Neo*.
*Neo* is a strange, rare, almost clay-like material found deep in the Nether (Y<64). It spawns in small clusters of ore. Neo Ore must be mined with a tier 3 pickaxe (diamond or similar). When mined, 1-3 Neo Chunks will be dropped with a little experience.

Neo Chunks are used to make Neo Bars, which are then used to make Compacted Neo blocks and other necessary crafting items.

Neo tools require Forge Energy to operate. They can't be enchanted via normal means; instead, *traits* are added to the tools through *Upgrade Schematics*. Traits add enchantments (some a level higher than normally obtainable) and/or other benefits to applicable tools. Only one trait can be *active* at a time, but more than one trait can be applied. To cycle through traits, press 'O' (by default, this can be changed in the controls menu). The tool will morph based on the active trait! Keep in mind, while a trait is active, more energy will be drained on use.

To use an Upgrade Schematic, place it in your *main hand* and the tool you want to apply its trait to in your *offhand*. Then, simply right click. If the trait is applicable, the Upgrade Schematic will disappear and the trait will be added to your tool. You can then place the tool in your main hand, and, if it has enough energy, you can cycle to the new trait.

Here is a chart detailing all available traits, their crafting ingredient, their supported tools and added benefits:
|    Trait   |    Material    |     Supported by     |                                  Benefits Added                                 |

|    Lucky   |     Diamond    |          All         |                      Fortune/Looting 3<br>(tool dependent)                      |

|  Efficient |   Gold Ingot   | Pickaxe, Axe, Shovel |                                   Efficiency 6                                  |

New to NeoArsenal version 1.1.0 are the *Incendiary Eye* and *Portable Charger*. The Incendiary Eye stacks up to 16 and behaves just like a Fire Charge; clicking the ground will set it on fire. However, Incendiary Eyes have a very long burn time; they last longer than lava buckets, making them a great source of fuel for furnaces or the Portable Charger. The Portable Charger charges any (and as of now, only) Neo tools in your inventory. It has 2 modes: burning and charging. Mode switching is done the same way traits are cycled, by pressing 'O'. Burning mode will search for stacks of coal, charcoal, or Incendiary Eyes in your inventory and consume them, converting them into burn time, which is then converted into energy over time. If you switch to charging mode, and there is still burn time remaining, the charger will pause burning and resume when set back to burning mode. In charging mode, the Portable Charger will distribute its stored energy to all Neo tools until it runs out. It must be supplied with fuel again if it runs out. The more tools it has to charge, the slower it will distribute energy. It will NOT work unless it is in your own inventory; it's *portable*. Don't leave it to charge in a chest!
